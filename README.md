# The FOODCO bunker buddy

The FOODCO bunker buddy(TM) is billed as "the perfect firearm for every occasion!". It was apparently developed by FOODCO when the kitchenware company briefly branched out into the military sector and supplied a group of revolutionaries with weapons and materiel. The basic frame can "easily" be converted into any firearm configuration imaginable. What the cheery sales pitch fails to mention is that A - the frames can't be resused, B - it's almost completely incompatible with off-brand gun mods, and C - for liability reasons, most of the parts need to be taken from a separate firearm. When fully assembled, base frames include a stock, several brackets for mounting FOODCO-compatible components, and for some insane reason, a pair of integrated knitting needles.

## Basic usage

The FOODCO bunker buddy starter kit, which can (hopefully) be found in pawn shops, home collections, gun stores, sporting goods stores, and military surplus, comes with everything you need to create a fully functional, fully customized FOODCO firearm... well, except the guns. You'll have to source those yourself. The box contains:

- One FOODCO bunker buddy
- Three FOODCO configuration frameworks
- Four FOODCO frames
- One instruction manual

To get started with your FOODCO bunker buddy, pick one of the configuration frames and install it onto your bunker buddy. The starter kit comes with standard, heavy, and pistol configuration frames, but rumor has it there might be other options... Bear in mind that this choice is permanent, as the configuration frame cannot be removed.

Once you've installed that, you have a FOODCO bunker buddy ready to accept several FOODCO gun mods (in this case, "mod" stands for "module" or "modular component" rather than "modification"). FOODCO mods can be swapped out freely just like (most) regular gun mods, but you'll have to craft them yourself. Fortunately, that's pretty straightforward: Most of them require a large or small FOODCO frame, a gun, some tools, and occasionally a pair of knitting needles, and instructions for all of them can be found in the instruction manual (included).

## Your gun here

This mod is very new and very incomplete. Leave your suggestions for new weapons/mods/attachments/recipes/lore and I'll see what I can do! Of particular note is the gun data on the weapons themselvesâ€”I don't really know what I'm doing there, so feel free to weigh in.
