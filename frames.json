        "description": "The FOODCO bunker buddy(TM) is billed as \"the perfect firearm for every occasion!\" and was apparently developed by FOODCO when the kitchenware company briefly branched out into the military sector and supplied a group of revolutionaries with weapons and materiel. The basic frame can \"easily\" be converted into any firearm configuration imaginable. What the cheery sales pitch fails to mention is that A - the frames can't be resused, B - it's almost completely incompatible with off-brand gun mods, and C - for liability reasons, most of the parts need to be taken from a separate firearm. A fully assembled bunker buddy typically features a large primary weapon set, a number of smaller, secondary weapon kits, and for some insane reason, an integrated pair of knitting needles.",
